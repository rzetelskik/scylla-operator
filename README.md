[Scylla Operator](https://github.com/scylladb/scylla-operator) is a Kubernetes Operator for managing and automating tasks related to managing ScyllaDB clusters.

[ScyllaDB](https://www.scylladb.com) is a close-to-the-hardware rewrite of Cassandra in C++. It features a shared nothing architecture that enables true linear scaling and major hardware optimizations that achieve ultra-low latencies and extreme throughput. It is a drop-in replacement for Cassandra and uses the same interfaces.
